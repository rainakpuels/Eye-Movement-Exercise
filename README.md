# About:

 [Click here to see the Eye Tracking Exercise in action.](https://rainakpuels.github.io/Eye-Tracking-Exercise)

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Full Stack Professional Certificate in Coding.

Using CSS, we created two eyes that have a movable iris in the center. The irises move with the JavaScript "onmousemove" event. 

I added in a custom "house fly" cursor so they eyes had something fun to follow around the screen.

# How to Run
